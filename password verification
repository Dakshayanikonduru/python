A website requires the users to input a username and password to register. Write a program to check the validity of password input by users. Following are the criteria for checking the password:

At least 1 letter between [a-z]
At least 1 number between [0-9]
At least 1 letter between [A-Z]
At least 1 character from [$#@]
Minimum length of transaction password: 6
Maximum length of transaction password: 12
Your program should accept a sequence of comma-separated passwords and will check them according to the above criteria. Passwords that match the criteria are to be printed, each separated by a comma.

Input Format:
The input consists of a single line string inputs separated by a comma(,).

Output Format:
The output consists of strings that satisfy the password condition separated by a comma(,). if there is no password that matches the condition, print "No password matches the condition".

Sample Input:
ABd1234@1, a F1#, 2w3E*, 2We3345

Sample Output:
ABd1234@1

l=input().split(',')

for i in l:
    i=i.lstrip()
    if len(i) in range(6,13):
        l1.append(i)
for i in l1:
    for j in i:
        if j.isupper():
            cap=cap+1
        elif j.islower():
            small=small+1
        elif j.isdigit():
            dig +=1
        else:
            char +=1
    if cap>=1 and small>=1 and dig>=1 and char>=1:
        l2.append(i)
    cap,small,dig,char=0,0,0,0
if len(l2)!=0:
    print(' ',end="")
    print(','.join(l2))
elif len(l2)==0:
    print("No password matches the condition")
