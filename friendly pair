 Program to find if the given numbers are Friendly pair or not (Amicable or not) is discussed here. Friendly Pair are two or more numbers with a common abundance.

Input & Output format: 

Input consists of 2 integers.
The first integer corresponds to number 1 and the second integer corresponds to number 2.
If it is a Friendly Pair display Friendly Pair or displays Not Friendly Pair.
For example,6 and 28 are Friendly Pair.

(Sum of divisors of 6)/6 = (Sum of divisors of 28)/28.

Sample Input:
6

28

Sample Output:

Friendly Pair

CODE:

n1=int(input())
n2=int(input())
l1=[]
l2=[]
for i in range(1,n1+1):
    if n1%i==0:
        l1.append(i)
for j in range(1,n2+1):
    if n2%j==0:
        l2.append(j)
if sum(l1)/n1==sum(l2)/n2:
    print("Friendly Pair")
else:
    print("Not Friendly Pair")
