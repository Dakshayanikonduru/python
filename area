Sheela has three things in her bag. She wants to compute the area of 3 things but 3 things are in different shapes. The three things are in square shape, rectangular shape, and circular shape respectively. Write a program to help Sheela to calculate the area of different shapes. 

Input format: 

First input: a side of a square in integer 

Second input: length of a rectangle in integer 

Third input: breadth of a rectangle in integer 

Fourth input: radius of a circle in float 

Output format: 

The first output should be the area of a square in integer 
The second output should be the area of a rectangle in integer 
The third output should be the area of a circle in float with 2 decimal places

Sample Input: 

5
5
4
2.0

CODE:

a=int(input("enter the side of square:"))
b=int(input("enter the length of rectangle"))
c=int(input("enter breadth of rectangle:"))
d=float(input("enter radius of circle"))
area_s=(a*a)
area_r=(b*c)
area_c=(3.14*d*d)
print("area_s=",area_s)
print("area_r=",area_r)
print("area_c=%.2f"%area_c)
